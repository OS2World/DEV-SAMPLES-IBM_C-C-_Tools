 NEW FEATURES
 _____________

 USER INTERFACE CLASS LIBRARY:

 Note: A detailed list of changes is provided in the file UILCHGS.LST.

 1. Obsolete classes

    a) Drag-drop

       Drag-drop and container drag-drop classes have been removed.  They
       are currently being redesigned to allow for greater portability in
       the future.

    b) IFillBox

       This class has been merged with IStaticText.

 2. New Classes

    a) IPageHandle

       Class to represent a page in a notebook.  Generally this class can be
       used similarly to the INotebook::Cursor class to identify a page.
       However, only this class is returned to identify a page queried from
       the notebook.  Specific information about a page can be obtained by
       calling the INotebook::pageSettings function, passing it an
       IPageHandle.

    b) IMenu::Cursor

       Cursor class to iterate items in a menu.

    c) ISpinButton::Cursor

       Cursor class to iterate entries in the spin button.

    d) ISubMenu::Cursor

       Cursor class to iterate submenu items.

 3. Interface Changes

    a) Renaming

       Several functions and styles have been renamed for consistency,
       including the change of occurences of "ownerDraw" to "drawItem".

    b) Corrections to the use of const

       Several functions and function arguments were made constant, as
       appropriate to their use.

    c) IBitmapControl / IIconControl

       These classes have been changed to inherit from IStaticText.  This
       allows text to be displayed with either a color-filled background,
       an icon as its background, or a bitmap as its background.  The text
       can optionally be omitted.

    d) Event posting and sending

       The functionality for posting and sending events has been moved from
       the IEvent class to IWindowHandle and IMessageQueueHandle.  This
       functionality in IWindow remains as well.

    e) IFrameWindow

       Frame windows now allow an IWindow (previsously an IControl) to be
       specified as a client area or an extension of the frame.

    f) IKeyboardEvent

       The isKeyCode() testing function has been replaced by individual
       functions that test for specific information about the event (for
       example, isScanCode()).

    g) IKeyboardHandler

       This class provides additional virtual functions to allow for easier
       handling of specific types of keyboard events (for example, the
       characterPress() function can be overridden to only process presses
       of data keys).

    h) INotebook::PageSettings

       The PageSettings class replaces the Page class.  This settings class
       is to be used to specify the characteristics of a page that is to be
       added to a notebook, or to return the characteristics of an existing
       page in the notebook.  Changes to an existing page in a notebook can
       only be made by calling "set" functions of INotebook.

    i) IMenu / IMenuItem

       The IMenuItem class has been changed to act as a settings class,
       similar to the INotebook::PageSettings class.  Thus the IMenuItem
       class is to be used to specify the characteristics of an item that is
       to be added to a menu, or to return the characteristics of a item in
       the menu.  Changes to an existing item in a menu can only be made by
       calling functions of IMenu.  Items in a menu are iterated using the
       IMenu::Cursor class.

    j) IMenuBar

       Additional styles and style-related functions have been added to this
       class.

       Additionally, various IMenuItem enumerations have been replaced by
       styles.

 4. Other Changes

    a) Static library names

       IBASE.LIB and IBASEAPP.LIB have been replaced by DDE4MUIB.LIB.
       IBASECTL.LIB and ICNR.LIB have been replaced by DDE4MUIC.LIB.
       IDDE.LIB has been replaced by DDE4MUID.LIB.
       IDRAG.LIB has been removed (see information on drag-drop classes
       above).


 RELEASE CONSIDERATIONS:
 _______________________

 USER INTERFACE CLASS LIBRARY:

 1. Using the Class Library DLL

    Any code using the User Interface class library that is built into a
    .dll must link to the class library dynamic link library, DDE4MUII.DLL.
    This means that the application .dll must be linked with the DDE4MUII.LIB
    export library instead of the static object libraries (DDE4MUIB.LIB,
    DDE4MUIC.LIB, and DDE4MUID.LIB).

    Additionally, if the application .exe is linked to a .dll built with
    DDE4MUII.LIB, the .exe also must be linked with DDE4MUII.LIB rather than
    with the class library static object libraries.  In either case, an .exe
    cannot be linked to both the class library .dll and any of its static
    object libraries -- only one or the other can be used at any one time.

    The above are permanent restrictions, and the results of doing otherwise
    are unpredictable.

 2. Known problems

    a) Colors and fonts

       Setting colors and fonts does not work reliably.

    b) IStaticText painting

       Painting performance of IStaticText objects is poor because of
       exceptions being internally thrown and caught.

    c) DLL load time

       This performance issue is being actively investigated.

 3. Future Changes

    The class names, function names and function arguments are subject
    to change.  Changes may result from IBM Quality and Usability reviews,
    functional corrections, problem fixes, or feedback from beta users.
